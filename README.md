# Introduction:
GIS usually users work with spatial data: data + coordinates and the given dataset is a real-time spatial dataset. So, it is very useful for GIS users. However, one of tthe most standard (de facto) file formats for every GIS software is the ESRI’s Shapefile (SHP) file format. Only few of them support user-formatted XML/JSON. One solution is using one of the OGC international standards: Web Feature Service (WFS)

# Objectives:
1) To support/implement OGC’s WFS requests and responses.
2) To extend the services to GIS users

# Tools and data:
KISTI’s dataset
PHP, JavaScript
GIS software, i.e., ESRI ArcGIS (commercial) and QuantumGIS (opensource)
